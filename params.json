{"name":"Qtoctave","body":"### What is QtOctave?\r\nQtOctave is a front-end for Octave. Octave is a math application similar to Matlab. Octave is a bit tricky, so QtOctave aims to make it use easier using a simple user interface.\r\n\r\nThis project was started some time ago but it was abandoned. I'm trying to update its source code. You can browse QtOctave's old website at [http://qtoctave.wordpress.com](http://qtoctave.wordpress.com)\r\n\r\nThere is a small [tutorial](http://qtoctave.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/guia_qtoctave.pdf) in spanish if needed\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nFirst, [download](https://github.com/luisivan/QtOctave/zipball/master) QtOctave \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ unzip file.zip\r\n$ cd QtOctave\r\n$ mkdir build\r\n$ cd build\r\n$ cmake ..\r\n$ make\r\n$ sudo make install\r\n```","tagline":"A front-end for Octave","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
